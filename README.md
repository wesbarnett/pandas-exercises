Jupyter notebooks with exercises derived from Pandas tutorial by Wes
McKinney. Originally these were iPython notebooks, but they have been
updated to be used with Jupyter. Additionally, a few functions in the
video have been deprecated in favor of newer alternatives, so those
have been updated in the notebooks.
